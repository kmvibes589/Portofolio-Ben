My advocacy focuses on empowering young people through human rights education, digital safety, climate action, and legal literacy. At Amnesty International Kenya, I support the Privacy First Campaign, advocating for a safer internet and data protection for youth. Through Lawrit Journal of Law and Legal Alliance Associates, I organize debates, workshops, and trainings that promote civic education, legal research, and climate awareness\u2014impacting hundreds of students across Africa.\n\nI was the youngest participant selected globally to attend the 2025 Venice School for Human Rights Defenders, and I've been named a Youth Delegate to two major events: the HISA Youth Fellowship in Oxford (23\u201326 August 2025) and the \"You(th) Rebuilding the Broken)\" Workshop in Brussels (31 July\u20133 August 2025), focused on youth-led democratic renewal.
